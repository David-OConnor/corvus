//! This module contains code for the DSHOT digital protocol, using to control motor speed.
//!
//! [Some information on the protocol](https://brushlesswhoop.com/dshot-and-bidirectional-dshot/):
//! Every digital protocol has a structure, also called a frame. It defines which information is at
//! which position in the data stream. And the frame structure of DSHOT is pretty straight forward:
//!
//! 11 bit throttle: 2048 possible values. 0 is reserved for disarmed. 1-47 are reserved for special commands.
//! Leaving 48 to 2047 (2000 steps) for the actual throttle value
//! 1 bit telemetry request - if this is set, telemetry data is sent back via a separate channel
//! 4 bit CRC: (Cyclic Redundancy) Check to validate data (throttle and telemetry request bit)
//! 1 and 0 in the DSHOT frame are distinguished by their high time. This means that every bit has a certain (constant) length,
//! and the length of the high part of the bit dictates if a 1 or 0 is being received.
//!
//! The DSHOT protocol (DSHOT-300, DSHOT-600 etc) is determined by the `DSHOT_ARR_600` and
//! `DSHOT_PSC_600` settings; ie set a 600kHz countdown for DSHOT-600.
