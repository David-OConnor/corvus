All of these are from perpspective of port on top, PCB towards you, wires away, left to right.
These are all from *the FC's perspective*. For example, on Diatone, the ESC has GND on the left!

ESC
T-motor: Gnd, Gnd, Bat, 10v out, 4, 3, 2, 1, CRT, Tx
Diatone: Curr, Tele, 4, 3, 2, 1, VCC, Gnd
Aikon: Tele, Cnt, 4, 3, 2, 1, Bat, Gnd (like Diatone, but Cnt/tele swapped)


Vtx
DJI: Pwr, Gnd, Fc TX, Fc Rx, GND, SBUS/HDL (Fc Rx)



# todo: Do you aim for identical pattern, or the reverse?
